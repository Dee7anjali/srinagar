                <div id="para1"><p>Khanqah-e-Moula (Kashmiri: خانٛقاهِ معلىٰ), also known as Shah-e-Hamadan Masjid and Khanqah, is a mosque located in the Old City <br>of Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir, India. Situated on the right bank of the<br> river Jhelum between the Fateh Kadal and Zaina Kadal bridges, it was first built in 1395 CE, commissioned by Sultan Sikendar<br> in memory of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani. It is held to be the first Khanqah—mosques associated with <br>specific saints—in the Kashmir valley. It is one of the best examples of Kashmiri wooden architecture, and is decorated with papier mache.[1</p></div>

                <div id="para2"><p>Hari Parbat is considered sacred by some Kashmiri Pandits.[5] According to Hindu Mythology, the area of Hari Parbat was inhabited by a daemon (asura) named Jalodbhava. People went on to pray to goddess Parvati for help. She took the form of a bird and dropped a pebble on the asura's head. The pebble grew larger and larger until it crushed the daemon. Hari Parbat is revered as that pebble, and Parvati is worshipped under the name Sharika, its temple occupying the middle part of the western slope of the hill. She is depicted as having 18 arms and sitting in Shri Chakra.[6][</p></div>
